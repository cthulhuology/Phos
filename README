Introduction 

Phos is a javascript library designed to make programming HTML5 canvas applications easier.  Most of
what it does is provide a coherent API for building interactive components.  It provides a unified
widget / drawing / event statemachine which seeks to minimize the overall complexity of the derived
applications.

Phosphor is a javascript development environment that allows the programmer to directly manipulate
the contents of live javascript objects.  The basic concept is that each text block can either be
evaluated (by pressing enter) or inspected (by right clicking).  For properties of objects, their
values can be set by changing the contents of the slot and then pressing enter.

Together Phos and Phosphor allow for the development of rich internet applications, in a dynamic and
exploratory fashion.  The user can either extend existing objects, or create new derived objects 
using "classy objects".  Rather than a traditional javascript prototype based inheritance, any object
can act as a "class".  Instances of that "class" are spawned using the "clone()" method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started

The easiest way to use Phosphor is to include both phos.js and phosphor.js in your HTML file:

	<script src="phos.js"></script>
	<script src="phosphor.js"></script> 

Then you initialize the system by invoking phos's boot function when the body loads:

	<body onload="boot(); Phosphor.init()">

This will by default add a canvas to the body object and set it to full window size.  If you'd like 
to preset the canvas side simply add a canvas element with the id='canvas'.

	<canvas id="canvas" height="320" width="240"></canvas>

You can then use the Phosphor system in your very little 320x240 canvas.

Tutorials

For a brief tutorial on how to use the Phosphor environment open the file Tutorial.html.  Under
Mac OS X you can open the file from the command line using:

	open Tutorial.html

Since Phos and Phosphor can be embedded into any HTML page,

I'm always happy to incorporate good ideas, especially if they make things simpler, smaller, and
faster.  If you'd like to use Phos or Phosphor in a commercial product, licensing and support
arrangements can also be made to meet your needs.
