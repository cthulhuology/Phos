Introduction 

Phos is a javascript library designed to make programming HTML5 canvas applications easier.  Most of
what it does is provide a coherent API for building interactive components.  It provides a unified
widget / drawing / event statemachine which seeks to minimize the overall complexity of the derived
applications.

Phos is also a javascript development environment that allows the programmer to directly manipulate
the contents of live javascript objects.  The basic concept is that each text block can either be
evaluated (by pressing enter) or inspected (by right clicking).  For properties of objects, their
values can be set by changing the contents of the slot and then pressing enter.

Together Phos allows for the development of rich internet applications, in a dynamic and
exploratory fashion.  The user can either extend existing objects, or create new derived objects 
using "classy objects".  Rather than a traditional javascript prototype based inheritance, any object
can act as a "class".  Instances of that "class" are spawned using the "clone()" method.

I'm always happy to incorporate good ideas, especially if they make things simpler, smaller, and
faster.  If you'd like to use Phos in a commercial product, licensing and support
